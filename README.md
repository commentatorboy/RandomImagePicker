# Random Image Picker
Created for a anime convention in Denmark. Pick a series of image inputs and it will choose an image randomly.
There will be no repeated images.

Create an img directory in the top level. Like this:

/img

index.html

random.txt

Put the images inside the img directory.

Just run index.html in your local browser.
Select the multiple images from that directory.

Conditions:
- do NOT have any spaces inside for each filename (due to how the code is structured by bloke)

Credits go to, from which I got some code from.
