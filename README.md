# RandomImagePicker
Created for the anime convention in Denmark. Pick a series of image inputs and it will choose an image randomly

create an img folder in the top level. Like this:

/img
index.html
random.txt

inside the img folder is all of the pictures.

Just run index.html in your local browser.

Credits go to, from which I got some code from.
