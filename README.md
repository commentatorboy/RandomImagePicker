# RandomImagePicker
Created for the anime convention in Denmark. Pick a series of image inputs and it will choose an image randomly
THIS IS CURRENTLY IN BETA AND NOT YET DONE!

create an img directory in the top level. Like this:

/img

index.html

random.txt

inside the img directory is all of the pictures.

Just run index.html in your local browser.
Select the multiple images from that directory.

Conditions:
- do NOT only select one picture. breaks it (will be fixed)
- do NOT have any spaces inside for each filename

Credits go to, from which I got some code from.
